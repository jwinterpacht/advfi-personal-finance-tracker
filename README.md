This was a semester long project that we undertook for IT326 - Principles of Software Engineering at Illinois State university.<br/><br/>
Adv-Fi was a project inspired by the now discontinued Intuit Mint, as we were not satisfied with the alternatives. Adv-Fi hopes to capture the same feeling of Mint, as well as putting our own spin on things with our Adv-Fi score, which was an idea inspired by weightlifting apps that give user a strength score. <br/><br/>
As we worked on the project, we created an SRS document to help plan our progress, alongside a use-case diagram, multiple sequence diagrams, and a class diagram to aid our efforts. <br/><br/>
As a team, we know the product could have been improved in multiple aspects, however we are still proud of what we have created. The opportunity to develop Adv-Fi was not just the opportunity to develop a piece of software, but was in irreplacable learning opportunity within the realm of software engineering. <br/> 
- We learned about important design patterns such factories, decorators, singletons, and many more that we had the chance to implement to really help us understand how we might one day use them in a professional environment.<br/>
- We got our first real taste of working on a large scale project with others, understanding the importance of version control software (like github) and the usefulness of branches when multiple people are working on the same repository at the same time.<br/>
- Adv-Fi also gave us a great opportunity to learn how to read documentation, as there were times where we had to import an external library and read the documentation to understand how to use it. Everyone in the group was already comfortable with this, but working on Adv-Fi was one of the first times we needed to do this with with added time pressure.<br/>
- We were also reminded of the importance of writing code that can easily be used by others. Since this project was entirely in python, a dynamically typed language, the python type hints for function parameters and return values were incredibly helpful. This allowed us to write code without needing to flip between files as often as we otherwise would have needed to. In addition, appropriately named functions and variables, along with adequate commenting, plus sticking to the diagrams, allowed for more rapid development. <br/>
<br/>
Overall, working on the Adv-Fi project has made each and every one of us a far better programmer than we were before. This was an environment where we were not only allowed to make mistakes, we were encouraged to do so. As a team, we did make quite a few mistakes in the first few months of working on Adv-Fi. This was frustrating at first, however when we got to to the final stretch, we knew exactly what to avoid that we had done in the past. <br/><br/>
The mistakes we made along the development path of Adv-Fi are nothing more than lessons we will remember and take with us as we move forward in our lives as Software Developers. <br/><br/>

If anyone is interested in getting AdvFi to work on their computer, you will need python and MySQL on your machine, then go to the command line and install yFinance and reportlab.<br/>
This can be done with the following commands: `pip install yfinance` and `pip install reportlab`. If you are running python3, then replace `pip` with `pip3`. <br/><br/><br/>

For the future of Adv-Fi, there are some small plans to fix the occasional bug, but the software will *likely* never be released as a full package.
